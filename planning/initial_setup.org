** Actions
Will have to be completed by the group to fulfill some condition
*** Putting up a node
**** rationale: fundamental to moving chips around
**** requires: 
***** consensus/majority from area
****** organizers acquire chip from residents--- brings 50%+ to site 
***** viable site
****** based on type of building/router/power
***** sucessful installation
*** having an active connection
**** somehow denote range with string... how do we deal with multidirectional broadcast?

** Events 
Seemingly random occurences effecting everyone
