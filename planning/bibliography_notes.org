* Rules of Play (salen2004rules)
** Core Concepts
*** Interaction and Choice
**** Structured vs Open
**** micro/macro level
*** Choice Structure {64}
**** 1 prechoice state (internal/mechanical)>
**** 2 choice presentation (external/phenomenological) >
***** Players need to see some way to proceed 
**** 3 choice selection interaction (internally processed as a conditional) > 
**** 4 choice result and externalities (internal, consequent) >
***** decisions need to feel important
**** 5 choice result communication to player (external - loop to 1)
***** changes in game state must be explicit
*** For meshlarp, we have
****  multiple interactions occuring simultaneously
***** mutually reinforcing a shared game-state
**** multiple agents working towards a goal
*** Role playing games (81) 
**** No winner, final objective 
**** rules keep it formal, but with less structured play
*** schemae
**** variables
**** multi-levelled
**** can represent objects and interaction
**** formalized and specific knowledge 
**** plays delivers a type of experience (through participation, observation, affect)
** RULES
*** How are our rules embodied in the roles and events themselves? 
*** Players act to validate one another achievements, and serve their own ends
*** How will tokens explain their own role in the game?
**** Elegant rules allow users to focus on play rather than rules
