* Community Technologist
** Role: 
Community technologists (CTs) are sources of technical expertise for their
communities.  They help their neighbourhoods to deploy networks, and
teach other people the skills they need to do the same.
** Tasks:
CTs use their string to measure the distance between *routers* and
_power sources_, which allows *network traffic* to pass over the
connection
** Tokens needed:
*** Network Traffic Tokens
* Organizer
** Role:
Organizers help to get communities together and pick sites for
routes. They use their abilities of planning and their social networks
to coordinate many people to act.
** Tasks:
Organizers need to rally communities together and get sites approve by
collecting _something???_ from residents and taking it to the site.
** Tokens Needed:
*** Resident approval markers
*** Bringing resources to sites for Events
* Router
** Role:
Routers allow people to send messages to one another, acting as
anchors/paths for *network traffic* 
** Tasks:
Routers amass and direct network traffic to other routers.
** Tokens Needed:
*** Network Traffic
* Site
** Role:
Sites are stationary, but not static, historical records. They accordingly store all of the validation work for establishing *routers*.
They are the nexus of all network traffic and are where routers are set up. 
* Network Traffic
** Since everyone uses a network, anyone can be network traffic
* Open Qs:
** Is there a need for a _main site_?
** How does network traffic work?
